## 🚀 **How to Use Your System**

### **Method 1: Direct Command Line (Recommended)**
```bash
python analyze_single_image.py "path/to/your/image.jpg"
```

### **Method 2: Interactive Menu**
```bash
python demo.py
# Then follow the prompts to select your image
```

### **Method 3: Programmatic Usage**
```python
from analyze_single_image import SingleImageTamperingDetector

detector = SingleImageTamperingDetector()
results = detector.analyze_image("your_image.jpg")
print(f"Confidence: {results['overall_assessment']['tampering_confidence']}")
print(f"Likely Tampered: {results['overall_assessment']['likely_tampered']}")
```

## 📈 **Interpreting Results**

### **Confidence Scores:**
- **0.0 - 0.3**: ✅ **Low** likelihood of tampering (likely authentic)
- **0.3 - 0.7**: ⚠️ **Medium** likelihood of tampering (suspicious, needs review)
- **0.7 - 1.0**: 🚨 **High** likelihood of tampering (likely manipulated)

### **Detection Method Confidence:**
Each method provides its own confidence score:
- **1.0**: Strong evidence of tampering detected
- **0.5-0.9**: Moderate evidence
- **0.0-0.4**: Little to no evidence
