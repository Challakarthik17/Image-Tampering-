## 📊 How It Works

### Quality Metrics Analysis (6 Key Areas)

1. **🌫️ Blur Detection (25% weight)**
   - Uses Laplacian variance to measure blur
   - Higher blur = higher tampering probability
   - Perfect for detecting motion blur or artificial blur

2. **⚡ Sharpness Analysis (25% weight)**
   - Calculates gradient magnitude for sharpness
   - Sharp images are typically more trustworthy
   - Detects over-sharpening or unnatural sharpness

3. **🔊 Noise Analysis (15% weight)**
   - Identifies unusual noise patterns
   - Tampering often introduces inconsistent noise
   - Filters out background noise from foreground

4. **📷 Compression Quality (15% weight)**
   - Analyzes JPEG compression artifacts
   - Multiple compression cycles indicate processing
   - Detects quality inconsistencies

5. **📐 Resolution Assessment (10% weight)**
   - Evaluates image resolution and pixel density
   - Higher resolution typically indicates authenticity
   - Flags unusually low-resolution images

6. **🎨 Color Analysis (10% weight)**
   - Checks color distribution and consistency
   - Detects unusual color patterns
   - Identifies color space inconsistencies

### Risk Assessment Scale

- **🟢 Low Risk (0-40%)**: High quality, likely authentic
- **🟡 Medium Risk (40-70%)**: Some quality issues, use with caution  
- **🔴 High Risk (70-100%)**: Significant quality problems, likely tampered
